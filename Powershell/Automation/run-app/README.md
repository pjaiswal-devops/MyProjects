## Run Application Script

This PowerShell script automates the process of running the application and logs its output. It checks for the existence of the executable, creates a log folder if necessary, simulates key presses, and redirects the application output to a log file.

### How to use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Modify the `PublishPath` variable in the `run-app.ps1` script to point to your application's directory.
3. Execute the script to start your application and monitor logs.
